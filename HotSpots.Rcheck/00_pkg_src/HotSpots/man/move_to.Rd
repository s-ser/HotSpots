Move to a Spot on the Board

\details{
We want to move to a spot on the board.
The player must input the spot the player is currently at, the spot the player
would like to move to, the number of chances the player has left, and the seed
designated at the beginning of the game.
Since the rules of the game only allow for a player to move one spot horizontally
or vertically, if the player requests to move to a spot that is not one spot
horizontally or vertically from the current spot, a message will print reminding
the player of that rule and what the current spot is.  They will also see where they
currently are on the board.
If the player requests to move to a spot that is allowed, the requested spot will
become the current spot.  Then, the function will check if the spot is a hot spot.
If the spot is a hot spot, the player will lose a chance and be sent back to the
starting spot (spot 1).
If the spot is not a hot spot, the player will stay at the desired spot and can
move again.
If the spot is the finishing spot (spot 25), the player has won the game and can
choose to start a new game using the new_game function.
